                    <!-- Common Pool Screen Problems -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Common Pool Screen Problems in Cape Coral</h2>
                        <p>Living in Cape Coral means dealing with specific environmental challenges that affect pool screen enclosures. Understanding these common issues helps homeowners identify problems early and prevent more costly repairs down the road.</p>

                        <h3>Torn or Damaged Screening Material</h3>
                        <p>The most frequent issue Cape Coral homeowners face is damaged screening material. Tears and holes can result from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Storm Debris:</strong> Tropical storms and hurricanes can send branches, leaves, and other debris into your screen enclosure, causing punctures and tears</li>
                            <li><strong>UV Degradation:</strong> Florida's intense sunlight breaks down screening material over time, making it brittle and prone to tearing</li>
                            <li><strong>Wildlife Damage:</strong> Birds, squirrels, and other animals may damage screens while trying to access your pool area</li>
                            <li><strong>Accidental Damage:</strong> Pool equipment, furniture, or recreational activities can accidentally tear screens</li>
                            <li><strong>Age and Wear:</strong> Even high-quality screening materials eventually wear out, typically lasting 10-15 years in Cape Coral's climate</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Loose or Separated Spline</h3>
                        <p>The spline is the rubber cord that holds screening material in the aluminum frame channels. Cape Coral's heat causes spline to become brittle and lose elasticity. When spline fails, screens sag, pull away from frames, or flutter in the wind. Professional spline replacement restores proper tension and appearance.</p>

                        <h3>Frame Damage and Corrosion</h3>
                        <p>Aluminum frames can suffer from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Storm Damage:</strong> High winds can bend or break frame members</li>
                            <li><strong>Corrosion:</strong> Salt air accelerates corrosion, especially on older powder-coated frames</li>
                            <li><strong>Structural Stress:</strong> Improper installation or design can cause frames to warp or crack over time</li>
                            <li><strong>Impact Damage:</strong> Falling branches or other impacts can bend or break frame components</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Screen Door Issues</h3>
                        <p>Pool cage screen doors take the most wear and tear. Common problems include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Torn screen material from frequent use</li>
                            <li>Broken or loose hinges</li>
                            <li>Malfunctioning latches and locks</li>
                            <li>Doors not closing properly or dragging on the ground</li>
                            <li>Spring mechanisms that need adjustment or replacement</li>
                        </ul>

                                <li>Large tears or holes allowing insects inside</li>
                                <li>Bent frame members that could fail completely</li>

                        <h3>Panel Rescreening</h3>
                        <p>Panel rescreening involves removing old, damaged screening material and installing new screen fabric. This is the most common repair service and includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Removing damaged screen and old spline</li>
                            <li>Cleaning frame channels thoroughly</li>

                            <li>Opportunity to upgrade to better screening materials</li>
                            <li>Typically more cost-effective than repairing many individual panels</li>
                            <li>Fresh, like-new appearance that enhances property value</li>
                            <li>Peace of mind knowing all screening is in top condition</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Complete rescreening projects typically take 1-3 days depending on enclosure size.</p>

                            <li><strong>Straighten Bent Members:</strong> Minor bends can often be straightened without replacement</li>

                            <h3>How long does pool screen repair take in Cape Coral?</h3>
                            <p>Simple repairs like rescreening individual panels typically take 30-60 minutes per panel. Complete rescreening projects for average-sized enclosures (800-1200 sq ft) usually take 1-3 days. Frame repairs add additional time depending on extent of damage. Many Cape Coral contractors offer same-day service for emergency repairs.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>What is the best time of year for pool screen repair in Cape Coral?</h3>
                            <p>Pool screen repairs can be done year-round in Cape Coral, but the dry season (November through April) offers the most ideal conditions. Avoid scheduling during hurricane season if possible, though emergency repairs may be necessary. Many contractors are busiest after storms and in peak season, so scheduling during slower periods may result in faster service and better availability.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How long do pool screens last in Cape Coral's climate?</h3>
                            <p>Screen lifespan depends on material quality and maintenance. Standard fiberglass screens typically last 7-10 years in Cape Coral's harsh coastal environment. Premium fiberglass lasts 10-12 years, while pet-resistant and specialty screens can last 12-15+ years. Regular cleaning and prompt repairs extend screen life significantly.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Do I need a permit for pool screen repairs in Cape Coral?</h3>
                            <p>Simple screen replacement typically doesn't require permits in Cape Coral. However, structural repairs, frame replacements, or modifications to the enclosure may require permits from the City of Cape Coral. Reputable contractors know local requirements and handle any necessary permits. Always verify permit requirements for your specific project.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Will homeowners insurance cover pool screen repairs in Cape Coral?</h3>
                            <p>Insurance coverage depends on your policy and cause of damage. Storm damage is typically covered under homeowners insurance (subject to deductibles). Normal wear and tear, age-related deterioration, and lack of maintenance are usually not covered. Document damage with photos, get professional estimates, and file claims promptly. Many Cape Coral contractors work with insurance companies and can help with the claims process.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Can individual panels be replaced, or does the whole enclosure need rescreening?</h3>
                            <p>Individual panels can definitely be replaced, and this is the most cost-effective approach for limited damage. However, new screening may not perfectly match faded older screening. If multiple panels need replacement, or your screening is more than 10 years old, complete rescreening often makes more sense and provides a uniform appearance. Professional contractors can help you decide the best approach for your situation.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>What's the difference between standard and pet-resistant screening?</h3>
                            <p>Pet-resistant screening uses heavier gauge vinyl-coated polyester instead of fiberglass, making it 7-10 times stronger. It resists tearing from pet claws and is ideal for doors and lower panels prone to damage. The trade-offs are higher cost (roughly double standard screening) and a slightly darker appearance. Many Cape Coral homeowners use pet-resistant screening for doors and high-traffic areas while using standard or premium fiberglass for walls and roof.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How much does it cost to rescreen a pool cage in Cape Coral?</h3>
                            <p>Complete pool cage rescreening in Cape Coral typically costs $2,000-$4,500 for average-sized enclosures (800-1200 sq ft), depending on materials chosen. Standard fiberglass runs $1.75-$2.50 per square foot, premium fiberglass $2.25-$3.00 per square foot, and specialty screening $3.00-$5.00 per square foot. Larger enclosures, frame repairs, or difficult access increase costs. Always get written estimates from multiple licensed contractors.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Can pool screen enclosures withstand hurricanes?</h3>
                            <p>Pool screen enclosures are designed for insect and debris protection, not hurricane-force winds. Most Cape Coral enclosures are rated for winds up to 130-140 mph when properly installed, but very strong hurricanes can cause damage. Before major storms, remove furniture and equipment that could become projectiles, and document the condition for insurance. Some homeowners install temporary storm panels for added protection. Proper maintenance and quality installation help enclosures survive most tropical storms and weaker hurricanes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Should I repair or replace my old pool screen enclosure?</h3>
                            <p>If your enclosure's frame is structurally sound and just needs new screening, repair is almost always more cost-effective. However, consider replacement if: the frame is severely corroded or damaged; you want to change the enclosure size or design; major structural issues exist; or repair costs approach 50-70% of replacement cost. A professional inspection can help you make this decision. Most Cape Coral enclosures with good frames can be successfully rescreened multiple times over their lifetime.</p>
